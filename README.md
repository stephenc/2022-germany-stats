# Germany COVID-19 Statistics history

This repository captures the German statistics and creates a git history of changes to those statistics.

Data is sourced from https://npgeo-corona-npgeo-de.hub.arcgis.com/datasets and scraped when ever I feel like it (because some of the files are too big and LFS costs money)
